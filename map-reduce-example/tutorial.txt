- interfaces explanation
    - to implement an interface, you must inmplement all of the abstract methods detailed in the interface
- to implement a map-reduce program, hadoop provides interfaces for the mapper and reducer functions
    - you must implement all of the abstract methods including in the specified mapper and reducer interfaces

Mapper Interface:
- takes in two values: K1, V1
- outputs two values: K2, V2
- you must implement the Map() function

Reducer Interface:
- must implement the Reduce() function

Step/Step:
1. Mapper Code - implement the mapper interface
2. Reducer Code - implement the reducer interface
3. Config Code/Driver Code
4. Run Final JAR in Hadoop
